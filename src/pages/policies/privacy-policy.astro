            At preline, our mission has always been focused on bringing openness
            and transparency to the design process. We've always believed that
            by providing a space where designers can share ongoing work not only
            empowers them to make better products, it also helps them grow.

          We're proud to be a part of creating a more open culture and to
          continue building a product that supports this vision.

          As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies such as
          Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their
          designers closer together to create amazing things. We've also learned
          that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better
          teams adapt and communicate with one another.

            To say that switching to Preline has been life-changing is an
            understatement. My business has tripled and I got my life back.

            Bringing the culture of sharing to everyone

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
            We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an
            opportunity for everyone to try Preline and explore how
            transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of
            one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs,
            management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design
            process earlier.

            Preline allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great
            way for leadership on the team to stay up-to-date with what
            everybody is working on," <a

          <li class="ps-2">
            Preline opened a new way of sharing. It's a persistent way for
            everyone to see and absorb each other's work," said David Scott,
            Creative Director at <a

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800">
          Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch
          the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they
          work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow designer, product manager,
          developer or client. Preline allows you to invite more people into the
          process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As
          those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in
          how they communicate and work together.
